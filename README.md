## Description
My answers to exercises given in this Udacity course about Deep Learning : https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730

I wanted to put everything in one project.

Currently, there are: 

1. Dataset manager: These are functions defined in the first notebook of the course to download the notMNIST dataset. I just wanted to put them together in one file.
2. MLP class: A class to construct multilayer networks with tensorflow.
3. Main: I use it to run my code.

My goal is to construct an MLP (MultiLayer Perceptron) that gives me the best score I can on the notMNIST dataset. 
I try to add more layers and to use regularization.
